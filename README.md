# sql-data-analytics-project

This is my personal toolkit of SQL scripts for real-world data exploration, analytics, and reporting. I wrote these queries to quickly profile databases, calculate core metrics, analyze time trends, run cumulative/cohort analytics, and do smart segmentation. Each script targets a specific analytical theme and shows the SQL patterns and best practices I actually use as a data analyst/BI developer.

## What‚Äôs inside
- Database exploration & profiling
- Business measures & metric calculations
- Time-series and period-over-period analysis
- Cumulative KPIs and cohort-style analytics
- Segmentation, filtering, and drill-downs
